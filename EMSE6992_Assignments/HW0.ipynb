    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to EMSE6992 (https://bsharvey.github.io/).  In this class, we will be using a variety of tools that will require some initial configuration. To ensure everything goes smoothly moving forward, we will setup the majority of those tools in this in class activity. While some of this will likely be dull, doing it now will enable us to do more exciting work in the weeks that follow without getting bogged down in further software configuration. This will not be graded, however it is essential that you complete it timely since it will enable us to set up your environments.  \n",

    "## Programming expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "All the assignments and labs for this class will use Python and, for the most part, the browser-based Jupyter notebook format you are currently viewing. Knowledge of Python is not a prerequisite for this course, **provided you are comfortable learning on your own as needed**. While we have strived to make the programming component of this course straightforward, we will not devote much time to teaching prorgramming or Python syntax. Basically, you should feel comfortable with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to look up Python syntax on Google and StackOverflow.\n",
    "* Basic programming concepts like functions, loops, arrays, dictionaries, strings, and if statements.\n",
    "* How to learn new libraries by reading documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many online tutorials to introduce you to scientific python programming. [Here is one](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures) that is very nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Python\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using Python throughout the course, including many popular 3rd party Python libraries for scientific computing. [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) is an easy-to-install bundle of Python and most of these libraries. We recommend that you use Anaconda for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the labs and assignments in this course are Python-based. This page provides information about configuring Python on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also see: http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 0** \n",
    "The Jupyter notebook runs in the browser, and works best in Google Chrome or Firefox. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Method: Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda Python distribution is an easily-installable bundle of Python and many of the libraries used throughout this class. Unless you have a good reason not to, we recommend that you use Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mac/Linux users\n",
    "1. Download the [appropriate version](http://continuum.io/downloads) of Anaconda\n",
    "1. Follow the instructions on that page to run the installer\n",
    "1. Test it out: open a terminal window, and type ``python``, you should see something like\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python 2.7.5 |Anaconda 1.6.1 (x86_64)| (default, Jun 28 2013, 22:20:13) \n",
    "```\n",
    "If `Anaconda` doesn't appear on the first line, you are using a different version of Python. See the troubleshooting section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test out the IPython notebook: open a Terminal window, and type `ipython notebook`. A new browser window should pop up. p\n",
    "1. Click `New Notebook` to create a new notebook file\n",
    "1. Update IPython to the newest version by typing `conda update ipython` at the command line\n",
    "1. Open the command prompt (type conda list --> pip install{see libraries below})\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows Users\n",
    "1. Download the [appropriate version](http://continuum.io/downloads) of Anaconda\n",
    "1. Follow the instructions on that page to run the installer. This will create a directory at `C:\\Anaconda`\n",
    "1. Test it out: start the Anaconda launcher, which you can find in `C:\\Anaconda` or, in the Start menu. Start the IPython notebook. A new browser window should open. \n",
    "1. Click `New Notebook`, which should open a new page.\n",
    "1. Update IPython to the newest version by opening a command prompt, and typing `conda update ipython`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you did not add Anaconda to your path, be sure to use the full path to the python and ipython executables, such as `/anaconda/bin/python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the Anaconda command prompt (type conda list --> pip install{see libraries below})\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing additional libraries\n",
    "Anaconda includes most of the libraries we will use in this course, but you will need to install a few extra ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)\n",
    "1. [Pattern](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pattern)\n",
    "1. [Seaborn](http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/)\n",
    "1. [MrJob](http://pythonhosted.org/mrjob/)\n",
    "1. [PyQuery](https://pythonhosted.org/pyquery/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended way to install these packages is to run `pip install BeautifulSoup mrjob pattern seaborn pyquery` on the command line. If this doesn't work, you can download the source code, and run `python setup.py install` from the source code directory. On Unix machines, either of these commands may require `sudo` (i.e. `sudo pip install...` or `sudo python`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening IPython Notebooks\n",
    "To view an IPython notebook, you must first start the IPython notebook server in the directory where the file lives. Simply navigate to this directory at the command prompt, and type `ipython notebook`. This will open a browser window, listing all the `ipynb` files in that directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Updating from older Anaconda versions\n",
    "You can easily update to the latest Anaconda version by updating conda, then Anaconda as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda update conda\n",
    "conda update anaconda\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**\n",
    "When you start python, you don't see a line like `Python 2.7.5 |Anaconda 1.6.1 (x86_64)|`. You are using a Mac or Linux computer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**\n",
    "You are most likely running a different version of Python, and need to modify your Path (the list of directories your computer looks through to find programs). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "Find a file like `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, or `.profile`. Open the file in a text editor, and add a line at this line at the end: `export PATH=\"$HOME/anaconda/bin:$PATH\"`. Close the file, open a new terminal window, type `source ~/.profile` (or whatever file you just edited). Type `which python` -- you should see a path that points to the anaconda directory. If so, running `python` should load the proper version\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**\n",
    "You are running the right version of python (see above item), but are unable to import numpy. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**\n",
    "You are probably loading a different copy of numpy that is incompatible with Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "See the above item to find your `.bash_profile`, `.profile`, or `.bashrc` file. Open it, and add the line `unset PYTHONPATH` at the end. Close the file, open a new terminal window, type `source ~/.profile` (or whatever file you just edited), and try again.\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**\n",
    "Under Windows, you receive an error message similar to the following: \"'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**\n",
    "The correct Anaconda paths might not be present in your PATH variable, or Anaconda might not have installed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**\n",
    "Ensure the Anaconda directories to your path environment variable (\"\\Anaconda\" and \"\\Anaconda\\Scripts\").  See [this page](http://superuser.com/questions/284342/what-are-path-and-other-environment-variables-and-how-can-i-set-or-use-them) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this does not correct the problem, reinstall Anaconda.\n",

    "In a gameshow, contestants try to guess which of 3 closed doors contain a cash prize (goats are behind the other two doors). Of course, the odds of choosing the correct door are 1 in 3. As a twist, the host of the show occasionally opens a door after a contestant makes his or her choice. This door is always one of the two the contestant did not pick, and is also always one of the goat doors (note that it is always possible to do this, since there are two goat doors). At this point, the contestant has the option of keeping his or her original choice, or swtiching to the other unopened door. The question is: is there any benefit to switching doors? The answer surprises many people who haven't heard the question before.\n",
